# DSA in PHP

Welcome to DSA in PHP! This repository serves as a reference for simple data structures and algorithms implemented in PHP.

## About

This repository contains a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science. It is intended to serve as a reference guide for developers looking to understand and implement these concepts in PHP.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **src/**: Contains the source code files.
  - **Algorithms/**: Directory for algorithm implementations.
  - **DataStructures/**: Directory for data structure implementations.

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented as a separate PHP class file within the respective directories under `src/`. You can explore the implementations and use them as a reference or integrate them into your projects as needed.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this repository is primarily for educational and reference purposes. While the implementations provided here are functional, they may not be optimized for production use. It is recommended to review and test thoroughly before using them in production environments.

## Contributions

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome! If you find any issues or improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
